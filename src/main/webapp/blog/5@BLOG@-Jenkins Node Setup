H3#@What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration software tool written in the Java programming language for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time. The software enables developers to find and solve defects in a code base rapidly and to automate testing of their builds.

Jenkins is a fork of a project called Hudson, which is trademarked by Oracle and is currently being developed parallel to Jenkins. The development community and its governing body hosts open meetings about the software.

H4#@Why should I use Jenkins?
To use Jenkins you need:
1.	An accessible source code repository, e.g., a Git repository, with your code checked in.
2.	A working build script, e.g., a Maven script, checked into the repository
Jenkins can be started via the command line or can run in a web application server. Under Linux you can also install Jenkins as system service.

H4#@Please follow below steps to set up your own Jenkins node on your local machine.

1.	First of all Download Jenkins artifact/war from:  http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/
2.	Configure environment variable called HUDSON_HOME.
	a. In Windows:
BOX_START#
START_BOX_CONTENT
	set HUDSON_HOME=C:\jenkins_home
BOX_END#
	
	b.In Linux :
BOX_START#
START_BOX_CONTENT
	export HUDSON_HOME=/home/ciuser/jenkins_home
BOX_END#

3.	Now, place downloaded Jenkins war file to $HUDSON_HOME directory. 
BOX_START#
START_BOX_CONTENT
	cp jenkins.war $HUDSON_HOME
BOX_END#
4.	Start jenkins node
BOX_START#
START_BOX_CONTENT
	java -jar jenkins.war
BOX_END#

5.	verify if node is working by opening browser and access jenkins at http://hostname:8080
